# parts of OOP
object literal

- constrictor fucntion
- prototypes
- classes
- instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars 
* Abstraction = to hide details (eg: fetch)
* Encpsulation
* Inheritance
* polymorphism.



### new keyword 
- The `new` keyword in programming languages like Java and JavaScript is used to create a new instance of a class or a new object¹². Here's why it's important:

1. **Instantiation**: The `new` keyword is used to instantiate a class, i.e., it creates an instance or object of the class¹.

2. **Memory Allocation**: When `new` is used, memory is allocated at runtime to hold the object¹. This memory is allocated on the heap, and a reference to this memory is returned¹.

3. **Constructor Invocation**: The `new` keyword also invokes the constructor of the class¹. This means it calls the method that initializes the newly created object¹.

4. **Array Creation**: In languages like Java, the `new` keyword can also be used to create new arrays¹.

In summary, the `new` keyword is essential for object-oriented programming as it allows for the creation and initialization of new objects or instances of classes¹². It's a fundamental part of languages like Java and JavaScript, enabling dynamic memory allocation and object-oriented design¹².
